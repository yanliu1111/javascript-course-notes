ES7+REACT/Redux/REACT-NATIVE SNIPPETS ----rfce

IMPORT COST

不要動public，可以有相同的文件替換

**-src / index.js**

==裏面call JSX components==

`<APP />`



**in src/app.js**   在js的function裏寫HTML，但是是extention的形式，實際是jsx

```
function APP(){
looks like HTML, but it is JSX file

}

```

-src / index.js 傳第 react App給html

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

in public/index.html

`<div id="root"></div>`

there ae two css files,

src/index.css is global styles, font family for your whole app, you apply from the body

App.css is actual the components you create

==webpack== compiled successfully

**In src/index.css**

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

React is library is not framwork.

Lot of way we can use the React , it is library, use the function they give you. You dont have to do it in a specific way. 

###  1. JSX

A syntax extension to JS

Looks like HTML

Help us to create components using tags we know from HTML

- use the tags we know from HTML， you can use in JSX / React
- section tag for example, usally not any tags, genertally 8 tags in your APP

How is it different from HTML?

- We use it to lay out our custom “components”, not just the base HTML tags

  below all not HTML tags, it is JSX tags

- ``` JSX
   <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
  ```

in index.js `import App from “./App”`, create App func in app.js

in js way, I shoud call the function like `App ()`, but in jsx , we should creat the component  like`<App />`, calling it when we write them as tag 

/ is closing, there nothing inside App so / close it. App is whole thing.

- Because we are writing it in a JS file, we can pass properties to the “tags” that result from JS expression!

For example becasue it is JS, so `href="https://reactjs.org"`cannot be static string. 

In JS, we can do `const url = “https://google.com”` then `href ={url}`

Becasue it is JS, so we can make it dynamic, not static

- There are a few other differences, including the way we have to write certain properties (re: “class” and “for”)

in HTML, we write class in tag, in React we write for

**Class** is key work in Js,  important input like **function** and **const**

instead `class` in html, we use `className`

other example, `<label for = "name">` but `for` has meaning in JS like forLoop, so we use `htmlFor="name"` differentship from `for` and `forLoop`when you write JSX

===

yarn or 

`npm create vite@latest` 

Type project name: Vite; Choose React and Js

`cd vite/`

`npm i`

`npm run dev`

### 2. What is a Component?

- Components are independent and reusable bits of code (Functions)
- Components have 4 Characters:
- different with HTML tags

1 Component’s name must be Capitalized

```JSX
<React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
```

2 return value must be JSX

You component is functin, return value must be JSX

3 Parameter values (properties) passed in - lovingly called ==props==

4 the data that,  when it changes, the component re-render-called ==state==

![1668001276034](../Typora Note/pic/1668001276034.png)



Whole app.js could be component,

layout, app.js holds three components NavBar, NewsFeed, FriendList

==2020, the React world learned that:==

1 We were doing Hooks wrong

2 Hooks are awesome! They allow us to focus on tasks and you can separate the concerns

3 Functional Components make for learner & cleaner code

==2021 and beyond:==

1 class and function components both valid

2 most new apps will use Functional components primarily and exclusively

3 Class components will slowly become ==legacy, maintenance and quaint==

**TODAY!**

1 COVER ONLY Func components and some key hooks

2 But everything we talks is valid when working with Class components

#### QUESTION

1. vite and yarn  ==> research vite

2. .git in React package

   如果我download zip從github上，從來不會複製.git。 只有在clone repo的時候才會 轉移.git.  

   儅 install create react package，如果你create在repo裏，就不會發生加入git的現象，React 自己發現自己在repo裏就不會創建git

   

3. *{ } what * means

   習慣在css裏創建，初始設置，最低level權限，表示對all element作用，不僅只是放在body裏

   

4. webpack

5. devdependencies: Vulnerable

   當你的游戲發表，別人使用這個游戲時，黑客會通過react-scripts黑進用戶電腦。聰明的方法就是把react-scritps放進devDependencies裏，就如同nodmon，只是用來作爲server，但是當你的游戲放到heroku上后，你已經不需要自己搭建server。所以react-script只對自己有用。

   `npm audit --production`查看所有軟件最終推送后production狀態的時會出現的漏洞文件，不考慮devDependencies

   `npm audit`--查看包括devDependencies裏的漏洞文件

6. 

```JSX
<p>
  Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
</p>
```

`<code>  </code>`就是一種寫code的formate格式，如同\```

7. `export default App;` what default mean

default 就是默認export，import page可以任意取名字，只要沒有在特定文件夾裏搜到這個 varible名字，就會用default export

```pseudocode
import file:
import anyVariableName from "./funcFile" //no need {}
import { sepecificFuncName}  from "./funcFile" // need {}


export file (this file name funcFile):
export default App; // means App function
export const specificFuncName=()=>{   }
```

8. `npx kill ???` fot ending port

$npx kill-port 3000

[kill-port](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kill-port)

9. Question, what is master and main in gitHub.

   master is used to call main of branch

   main is in local callName, master is in github callName.

   以前都叫master

   when create new repo, connect the file with the exist repo, the first step is rename to main `git branch -M main`

#### Properties

 are passed in as arguments to the function

Props can send data from parents

If I want app.js 裏的url google.com，送給child Title.js, 因爲child file needs this url

```jsx
const LittlestCompinent = (props) => {
	return <div />
}
```

pass the argument from parent component to its children components, parents has it, and child needs to know about it. 

`<div />` is component name

```jsx
const SecondLittleComp = (props) =>{
	const [fred, setFred] = useState ();
	return <div />;
}
```

#### Hooks

are functions, you can use in react component, help you manage the state, the data of your app, how react do to change that state, the function is making your app interactive

.jsx  = icon, show which js is your components

`useState` is hooks , react it’s changing

`const [fred, setFred]`fred is ==State== variable, ==State Set== function is setFred

State is data is relate to your App. State is like player score, score change is your game, that means state

#### A tree

a React app is tree of components

```jsx
const App = () => {
	return <LittlesComponent />;
}
```

\<LittlesComponents /> parent 大多數裏面是component, ==to next branch of tree==

```jsx
const LittlesComponent = (props)=>{
	return <p>Hello World!</p>;
}
```

useState return is in the array,

==Fred is variable,  then you call function setFred, then you give Fred a new value.== So setFred can re-draw the UI for the component.

![1668005079659](../Typora Note/pic/1668005079659.png)

==App(parent) doesnt render any text to browser, parent only send attribute to child, acturally child render text to the browser==

We can put { js script } in attribute. 

js.script is not part of HTML or tag,  so we use { }.

Anything between { }, it is JS

{} between \<p> and \</p>, we want to see the value inside of variable text

#### A Quick Word About State

`const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`

setCount is function, if I want to change the value, I can use `count =3`

const only for the `useState` formate , go through `setCount`change value on count. Showing data changes

useState call initializes the state variable to the value passed to useState()

count start a value--> pass in useState() init

if don’t just start undefined (if no value pass in ==useState())

==undefine, null, empty array== those all not show up at all inside browser

inside { } is Javascript value. 

`<button onClick={() => increaseCount()}` build a new func

`<button onClick={increaseCount}` new function you want to call

就是换行的意思，<*br*>是html5的写法，不用封闭的，<*br* />封闭式的是严格话的写法，表示在网页中换行. 



####  useState, setCount

when you call useState, the back would do this 👇

```pseudocode
let count = 0
function setCount (newArg) {
    
    if (newArg instanceof Function) {
      newArg (count)
    } else {
      count = newArg
    }
    
}
    
```

👇👇👇👇👇👇

```javascript
function increaseCount() {
    setCount((oldValue) => {
      return oldValue + 1;
    });
  }
```

if `newArg` is function,

whatever the `oldValue`is counted, it is set by pass in `setCount`

if you pass not a function,

reassign the value  where you state `count = newArg`

whatever the variable   `currValue`  associate with `setCount` , is get to pass to this function, that is `setCount` build it

if you only pass a number, you dont have to set `currValye`, you can do like this `setCount(5)`

if you want to relly on `currValue` 👆 that is better to do this 

Bad for `setCount (count +1)` it may store the old value. rather than run the times, after the change.

The `currValue` means 12 times clicks, you would get the newest value to continue.

```pseudocode
setCount ((curr)=> {
	return curr +1;
});
```



### 3. Bonus Exercise - Add Some Style

There are several approaches to style components in React. We can use native CSS, a CSS framework like Tailwind, or use an existing styled component library such as ==Semantic UI== or ==Material UI== (there are several - just google for “react styled component libraries” to see several
“top 10 lists”)

For this exercise, add some style using the method of your choice. If you want to try Semantic UI, here’s something to get you started:

1. Start with Option 1 of Get Started page of Semantic-UI React
(https://react.semantic-ui.com/usage)





#### To Cb question:

I imagine I could just make it a class and use className to get what I was looking for instead of being generic Sure I can share what I was trying to do

```javascript
let text = document.querySelector("p")
const swapColor = (text) => {
        text.classList.toggle('p1', 'p2')
    }
return (
        <button id='secondButton' onClick={() => {
            increaseCount();
            swapColor(text)}}
            >Increase the Count</button>
    )
```



 Dani answer：

```javascript
const Component = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("blue")
  const toggleColor = () => {
    if (color === "blue") {
      setColor("red")
    } else {
      setColor("blue")
    }
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <p style={{color: color}}>
         Some text
      </p>
      <button onClick={()=>toggleColor()}>Toggle Color</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

or,  

```javascript
const Component = () => {
  const [colorClass, setColorClass] = useState("p1")
  const toggleColor = () => {
    if (colorClass === "p1") {
      setColorClass("p2")
    } else {
      setColorClass("p2")
    }
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <p className={colorClass}>
         Some text
      </p>
      <button onClick={()=>toggleColor()}>Toggle Color</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
