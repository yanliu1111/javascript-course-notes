| ID   | Cover     | Weather   | Time    | Time of day | Temp  | Data   |
| ---- | --------- | --------- | ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| 1    | Jacket    | Sunny     | 6am     | Morning     | 9deg  | Sep 7  |
| 2    | No Jacket | Not sunny | 5:45pm  | Night       | 18deg | Sep 7  |
| 3    | No Jacket | Sunny     | 12:15pm | Afternoon   | 22deg | Sep 19 |
| 4    | Jacket    | Not sunny | 9:56pm  | Night       | 2deg  | Sep 20 |

<u>future data with unknown variables</u>

#### Data mining stpes:

1. Data cleaning - remove noise and inconsistend data
2. Data integration - conbine daata from multiple sources. eg: combine data to our manually generated data
3. Data selection - select **relevant** for the analysis task at hand
4. Data transformation - transform data into forms appropriate for mining eg: convert sunny and not sunny to 1 and 0
5. Knowledge discovery - identify the truly interesting patterns eg: save money by not buying Jecket
6. knowledge presentation - fancy dashboard

#### Machine Learning, AI and Deep learning

ml will build on historical data

ML:

- supervised learning: Classification, Regression

- unserpervised learning: Clustering

Supervised learning: grade the students on their exam , we know customers bought already, you know already some resources

==classification:== predicting discrete or categorical values

**Discrete or categorical variable**

==Regression== - predicting continous values

**Continous variable**

==Clusting== - not class labeled

Clustering time of day

How to practically use ML

1. Business/Problem Understand
2. Data Understand
3. Data preparation
4. Modelng
5. Evalution
6. Governance
7. Deployment

### Business Understanding

- Business domain expertise
- Problem context 

column -- features

What kind of data can be minded?

- Tabular Data
- Multimedia data: images, videos, and audio
- Text data e.g text from documents and chat
- Time Series - e.g weather data stock data etc. 

### Data preparation

#### Explore and analyze:

1. Distribution of features
2. Relationship between features: corelation between two features
3. Descriptive statistics
4. Missing values

#### Wrangle and transform data:

transform data

Generate new features

Treat missing values: 1 delete missing rows

2 fill missing values maually

3 use a global constant to fill in missing values

4 use most probable values 

5 

Training data = Testing set

### Modeling

Model / Algorithm / Hyperameters / Model Tuning

### Evaluation

Accuracy and error rate of model

Receiver Operating Charateristics (ROC) Curves -- a plot of true positive rates against false - positive rates

Evaluating classification Model

Optimal ROC curve - shifted towards the upper left comer of the plot

Use model base on the history, predict for the future.

### Deployment
