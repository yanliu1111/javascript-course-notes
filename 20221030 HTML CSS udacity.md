## HTML

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is heading.</h1>
    <p>This is paragraph</p>
    <span>This is span</span>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="a picture" />
  </body>
</html>
```

\<P>\</P> This whole thing is called a paragraph element.

opening tage and closing tag, content is the middle.

image doesnt have close tag, `<img src="image.jpg" alt="a picture" /> `also called an element

A span is like a line of text and it isnt really seperate from other pieces of text. 

Spans are part of a line.

<u>Every type of element will display differently.</u>

/<meta charset="utf-8"> is pretty standard, and will allow your website to display any Unicode character.
