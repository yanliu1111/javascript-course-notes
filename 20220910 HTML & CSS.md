### 63 Basic HTML structure and Elements

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Learning HTML and CSS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Javascript is fun, but so is HTML & CSS!</h1>
    <p>
      You can learn Javascript without HTML and CSS, but for DOM manipulation
      it's useful to have some basic ideas of HTML & CSS.
    </p>
    <h2>Another heading</h2>
    <p>Just another paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

\<!DOCTYPE html> --  !+tab

means  this document as being HTML five

### 64 Attributes, Classes and IDs

hypertext reference, put the URL should point to

\<a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/">  Jonas on Udemy \</a>

We call the anchor element an inline element.

\<h> head is block element, not an inline element

\<img.. />  doesnâ€™t have closing tag. image doesnâ€™t have closing tag, we donâ€™t put written contend in here

==Notice==, hypertext and resource belong to anchor and image resource, they donâ€™t affect each other. 

We use classes and ids to essentially name elements, so that we can then select them in CSS in order to style them.  We also use ids and classes to select elements from JavaScript when we do dumb manipulation. 

Class and ids are crucial to identifying elements and especially classes. 

Different between class and id, id must unique. 

ID only can be used once in this page while classes can be used over and over again.

It is better to use ==class==

So id name but also for class names (course-image) in CSS,  we use the dash to separate two different words.  In JS, we would use camel case (courseImage). 

This is just ==convention==.

```html
   <div id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in this form :)</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <button>OK!</button>
    </div>
```

HTML has specific element for this, we used form instead of div.

```html
   <form id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in this form :)</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <button>OK!</button>
    </form>
```

It looks exactly the same but this is more <u>semantic è¯­ä¹‰</u>

using appropriate element according  to the content thatâ€™s in it, is the idea of semantic HTML. In this case we are creating a form here, because of input and button, so we use the form element that HTML gives us just for this purpose.

It looks exactly the same as a div element, but it has meaning and so itâ€™s semantic.

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Learning HTML and CSS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Javascript is fun, but so is HTML & CSS!</h1>
    <p class="first">

    <h2>Another heading</h2>
    <p class="second">Just another paragraph</p>
    <img
      id="course-image"
      src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/437398_46c3_10.jpg"
    />

    <div id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in this form :)</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <button>OK!</button>
