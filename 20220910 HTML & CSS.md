### 63 Basic HTML structure and Elements

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Learning HTML and CSS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Javascript is fun, but so is HTML & CSS!</h1>
    <p>
      You can learn Javascript without HTML and CSS, but for DOM manipulation
      it's useful to have some basic ideas of HTML & CSS.
    </p>
    <h2>Another heading</h2>
    <p>Just another paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

\<!DOCTYPE html> --  !+tab

means  this document as being HTML five

### 64 Attributes, Classes and IDs

hypertext reference, put the URL should point to

\<a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/">  Jonas on Udemy \</a>

We call the anchor element an inline element.

\<h> head is block element, not an inline element

\<img.. />  doesnâ€™t have closing tag. image doesnâ€™t have closing tag, we donâ€™t put written contend in here

==Notice==, hypertext and resource belong to anchor and image resource, they donâ€™t affect each other. 

We use classes and ids to essentially name elements, so that we can then select them in CSS in order to style them.  We also use ids and classes to select elements from JavaScript when we do dumb manipulation. 

Class and ids are crucial to identifying elements and especially classes. 

Different between class and id, id must unique. 

ID only can be used once in this page while classes can be used over and over again.

It is better to use ==class==

So id name but also for class names (course-image) in CSS,  we use the dash to separate two different words.  In JS, we would use camel case (courseImage). 

This is just ==convention==.

```html
   <div id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in this form :)</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <button>OK!</button>
    </div>
```

HTML has specific element for this, we used form instead of div.

```html
   <form id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in this form :)</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <button>OK!</button>
    </form>
```

It looks exactly the same but this is more <u>semantic è¯­ä¹‰</u>

using appropriate element according  to the content thatâ€™s in it, is the idea of semantic HTML. In this case we are creating a form here, because of input and button, so we use the form element that HTML gives us just for this purpose.

It looks exactly the same as a div element, but it has meaning and so itâ€™s semantic.

    <h2>Another heading</h2>
    <p class="second">Just another paragraph</p>
    <img
      id="course-image"
      src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/437398_46c3_10.jpg"
    />

    <div id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in this form :)</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <button>OK!</button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 65 Basic Styling with CSS

Style element goes in head, head is for setting the page

Head definitely counts as a setting

Proper name and value.

Font-family: inherit, parent and child elements all get Font adjust / most are not inherit

Font-size: inherit, but predefine h1 and h2 automatically are applied, can be overwrite

Border is not inherited.

### 66 Introduction to the CSS Box Model

![CSS1.20220913JPG](../Typora Note/pic/CSS1.20220913JPG.JPG)

==box-sizing: border-box;== We always use it, essentially what this does is that it will include paddings and borders into the width or the height that we specify for an element. For example, if we specify the width of an element to 100pixels, and then add a padding of 20pixels on each side, then 100+20+20=140 which could create a problem if all we wanted was a width of 100pixels. 

So to fix this, we use box sizing set to border box. So if we set 100pixels, it always be 100 pixels. no matter how many the padding.

The difference between inline and block elements



This course we didn't learn positioning, flexbox or CSS grid or many other important topics, but it wasn't also really the goal in this course.
